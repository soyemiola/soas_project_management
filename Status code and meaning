Status code and meaning

Successful 

200 OK
201 Created - The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. 
				This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.


User Error 

400 Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error 
					(e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).


401 Unauthorized	-	Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". 
						That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.

403 Forbidden	-	The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, 
					so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server.

404 Not Found	-	The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized.

405 Method Not Allowed	-	The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource. 
							For example, an API may not allow calling DELETE to remove a resource.


Server error responses

500 Internal Server Error	-	The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.

502 Bad Gateway	-	This error response means that the server, while working as a gateway to get a response needed to handle 
					the request, got an invalid response.
